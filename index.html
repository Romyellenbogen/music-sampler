  <p>Sufjan Stevens is a singer-songwriter from Detroit, Michigan. He works under the label Asthmatic Kitty, which he co-founded with his father. Though his first album came out in 1999, he gained critical success with his 2005 album "Illinoise." He plays multiple instruments and his music features Christian themes, though he doesn't often talk publically about his beliefs. In 2018 he got an Oscar nomination for his song Mystery of Love, which was featured on the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack.</p>

    I'm Romy Ellenbogen, a senior studying journalism at the University of Florida. I started listening to Sufjan Stevens when I was about 14 years old and fell in love with his tender songs, lyricism and folksy tone.
